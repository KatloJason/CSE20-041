                    Queen Charlotte islands and the British Columbia coast Rivers Inlet to celebrate the Golden Jubilee
                    in
                    1936. The poles were moved to the more accessible and attractive Brockton Point in the 1960s, and
                    have
                    been there ever since. The purpose of these totem poles was to pay respect to the original settlers
                    of
                    the beautiful land known as Vancouver. </p>

                <h1 id="lifestyledifficulties">LIFESTYLE DIFFICULTIES</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Apart from all the amazing things Vancouver has to offer, unfortunately, like every other city, it
                    has
                    it's flaws too.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 id="costofliving">COST OF LIVING</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Vancouver is undoubtly one of the most expensive cities in Canada, together with Toronto. Although
                    unlike
                    Toronto, Vancouver is also the most expensive city in North America.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Regarding housing, rent in particular, is ridicularly high. A single-bedroom apartment in the city
                    center
                    costs approximately 2000 CAD on average (1500 USD). Moreover, mobile phone plans, transport, which
                    will
                    be around 100 CAD (75 USD), groceries, as long as other monthly expenses are said to be more
                    expensive
                    as compared to the rest of Canada.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 id="weather">WEATHER</h3>
                <br>
                <p>According to the majority of Vancouver residents, the fact that it rains most of the year can be
                    regarded
                    as one of the toughest things about living there. They say the wet and freezing climate can be
                    unbearable, regardless of how long you have living there.</p>
                <br>

                <h3 id="jobopportunities">JOB OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
                <br>
                <p>As Vancouver is a fast growing city, the job market has quickly gotten saturated, making it really
                    difficult to find a well paying job, regardless of the qualifications you have acquired.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>RELATIONSHIPS</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Being quite a small city, most people living in Vancouver have known each other for as long as they
                    can
                    remember, dating back to their middleschool days. This results in people sticking with the same
                    people
                    they grew up with, making it quite difficult for people who are new in town to form relationships.
                </p>

                <h1 id="positiveaspects">POSITIVE ASPECTS</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Although it may look like Vancouver is not an ideal place to settle in, that is definately not the
                    case.
                    Not only is the cost of living high, but also the standards of living, which is the quality of life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The people of Vancouver, Vancouverites, enjoy high wages with the average annual salary being about
                    75,000 CAD (56,000 USD). In addition, the quality of the healthcare system is magnificent, covering
                    everyone who legally resides in British Columbia through the Medical Services Plan (MSP). Residents
                    only
                    have to pay a monthly premium, which is deducted from their wages, which provides coverage for all
                    health related costs. </p>
                <br>
                <p>One of the perks of the horrible raining weather is that when it is raining in the city, out by the
                    mountains, snow will be frequent. Thus, snow sports like snowboarding as well as skiing, are
                    practically
                    done all year round!</p>
