            <h1>THE CITY OF VANCOUVER</h1>

            <p>Vancouver is a major city located in western Canada, with a population of 2,606,000 (2021), and a growth
                rate of 0.97%. From the year of 2020, the city has gained 25,000 people, despite having a low area of
                only 115 square kilometre. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The city is the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada, with a sky high population density of
                over 5,400 people per square kilometre, thus making it the fifth-most densely populated North-American
                city, with over 250,000 residents, behind New York city, Guadalajara, San Fransisco, and Mexico City.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Surprisingly enough, 52% of the residents in Vancouver are not native english speakers, making it one of
                the most ethically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The city takes its name from George Vancouver, who was a british officer of the Royal Navy, who explored
                and charted North America's northwestern Pacific coast reagions in 1792. He gave various places british
                names as well.</p>

            <h1 id="history">HISTORY</h1>

            <p>The original inhabitants of Vancouver included Indians and Europeans. However, few people of european
                descent lived in the area until the late 1850s, when New Westminster, now a suburb of Vancouver was
                established.</p>

            <img id="newwestminster" src="images/images/new westminster.jpg" alt="New Westminster image"
                title="Old New Westminster">

            <br>

            <p>Around 1860, thousands of miners, mainly from USA, moved into the region, being lured by the amount of
                gold that was in the Cariboo Mountain, to the northeast. The Scottish, along with some americans, really
                contributed alot to the city. In fact, the suggestion to name it Vancouver, was made by William Van
                Horne, an American who was president of the Canadian Pacific Railway.</p>

            <img id="williamvanhorne" src="images/images/william van horne.jpg" alt="William Van Horne image"
                title="William Van Horne">

            <p> Not only that, but the city's most
                elected mayor ( who was voted for nine non-consecutive terms from 1919 to 1933 ), L.D. Taylor, was also
                originally from the USA. </p>

            <img id="ldtaylor" src="images/images/LD-Taylor.jpg" alt="L.D. Taylor image" title="L.D. Taylor">

            <br>
            <p>Furthermore, the first important industry in the area, a sawmill on Burrard Inlet, was owned by an
                American. This just comes to show that the Americans practically made Vancouver what it is today.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Originally called Granville in the 1870s, Vancouver was just a small settlement relying mainly on
                sawmilling. It was officially classified as a city in April 1886, and was renamed in honor of the
                English navigator George Vancouver, of the Royal Navy who had explored and studied the coast in 1792.
                Sadly enough, after a mere 2 months of it being classified as a city, it was devistated by a disastrous
                fire in less than an hour.</p>

                alt="the great vancouver fire image" title="The Great Vancouver Fire">

            <br>

            <p>The city overcame the situation, becoming a prosperous port in the process, which was partly due to the
                opening of the Panama Canal in 1914, which made it economically possible to export grain and lumber from
                Vancouver to the east coasts of USA and Europe.</p>

            <br>

            <p>In 1929, Point Grey and South Vancouver, which are two suburbs to the south, joined forces with Vancouver
                , making its metropolitan area become the third most popular in Canada. By 1930, Vancouver was Canada's
                major Pacific coast port and after World War II, it cultivated into Canada's main business area for
                trade with the Pacific Rim and Asia.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>Since World War II, alot of East Asians, mainly Chinese, immigrated to Vancouver. This resulted in a
                couple of Anti-Asian riots and alot of discrimination towards them in the early years of the city. An
                example of such discrimination is the <i>Komagata Maru</i> incident of 1914, on which a group of people
                from British India tried to immigrate to Canada, using a Japanese steamship named Komagata Maru, but
                were denied entry and forced to return back to Kolkata, India. The Indian royal police at the time
                attempted to apprehend the group the group leaders, resulting in riots. The police then fired shots,
                resulting in the deaths of 20 people.</p>

            <br>

            <p>All the public schools in British Columbia offer free education, as well as providing all the students
                with the material they will requiren to complete the whole duration of their school life. This is such a
                wonderful previledge that the children in British Columbia have access to. Furthermore, because of this,
                the educational foundation children have is nice and solid, making them well prepared by the time they
                enroll in a university.</p>

            <p>Talking about universities, one of the best in the whole of Canada, the University of British Columbia
                (UBC),
                is located in Vancouver, British Columbia. This university is not only one of the best in Canada, but is
                also constantly featured in the top 50 universities worldwide. The University of British Columbia is a
                major research facility that uses top of the range facilities including one of the world's leading
                laboratories for subatomic physics and one of the best concert halls in the world, the Chan Centre for
                Performing Arts.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Excluding UBC,there are also a number of really good universities in the area, that are quite affordable

            <h3 id="safety">SAFETY</h3>
            <br>

            <p>Vancouver is generally a very safe area for both tourists and the residents of the city. However, like
                every other big city, there are distinctive areas that are often victims of crime, more than others. The
                most recognizable area is Downtown Eastside, also known as "The DTES", that is located relatively close
                to the famous Gastown and Chinatown.</p>
            <br>

            <p>DTES is one of the city's oldest neighbourhoods, meaning it's not as developed as the newer areas in
                Vancouver. Recently, it has been exposed to a lot of prostitution but does not pose a threat to the
                safety of tourists regardless.</p>

            <h3 id="infrastructure">WELL-MAINTAINED INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
            <br>

            <p>The roads in Vancouver regularly undergo routine maintenance as a way to ensure they are safe for
                civilians. These maintenances include pothole patching, street cleaning, ice and snow control in the
                snowy winters, as well as line marking, just to name a few. In addition to these routine maintenances,
                the roads are fully repaved annually to increase their longevity.</p>
